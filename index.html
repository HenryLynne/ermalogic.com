          Most typically, a web application is stored on a remote server and accessed via the internet.
          Web apps can provide the users with interactive, dynamic, and browser-based experience.<br>
          Some examples of web apps are e-commerce, social networking, or data management system.<br>
          Web application can sometimes be confused with website or webpage, but web application is normally developed in tandem with
          a corresponding website or webpage, and they both share some components.
